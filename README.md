## Color Token Sync Repository

This repository is responsible for maintaining and synchronizing color tokens across our design system and codebase using the Design Tokens Studio Figma plugin. These color tokens are centralized to ensure consistency across all platforms, and are synchronized from two key Figma libraries:

	•	BetaNXT Custom Components Library: This custom library includes specific color tokens and components designed for BetaNXT. Access the library here.
	•	MUI v5.16.0 Figma Library: This library includes Material UI color variables that are referenced within our design system. Access the library here.

## Setup

	1.	Ensure you have the Design Tokens Studio plugin installed in Figma.
	2.	Open the Figma files linked above and sync the color tokens to the repository using the plugin.
	3.	Use the plugin’s export feature to pull the tokens into the appropriate format for use in development.

## Contribution Guidelines

	•	All changes to color tokens must be made in the corresponding Figma libraries.
	•	Sync the updated tokens using the Design Tokens Studio plugin and ensure they are correctly reflected in this repository.
